Final Project

## Objective

Betweenness Centrality: Find the Vertex which is most commonly on the shortest path from all other Vertices to all other Vertices. In the context of our dataset (airports and routes), this can be inferred as the airport which is most likely to be part of the shortest route between 2 other airports. 

## Dataset

Both the airports and routes information can be found in the `datasets` folder under the names `airports.txt` and `routes.txt`, respectively.

## Main

1. `make main` to compile and link
2. `./main` to run and find the most central Vertex (airport)

## Tests

1. `make test` to compile and link
2. `./test` to run all tests

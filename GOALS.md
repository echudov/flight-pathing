# Project Goals

## Data Set
OpenFlights - After professor Woodley left such an impression on us last semester in CS126, we decided we want to follow in his footsteps by learning more about the commercial aviation industry.

## Implementation
### Traversal
BFS

DFS

We will be using BFS and DFS to solve the more complex algorithms listed below
### Covered
Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm 

Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

These are variations of a shortest path algorithm, and we will implement both of them. This will allow us to find the shortest flight route between two airports. 
### Complex/Uncovered
Betweenness Centrality - This algorithm checks to see the node(s) on the graph with the most centrality - i.e. which node can most easily access all the other nodes on the graph. In the context of our project, this will mean finding the airport from where you can most easily get to every other airport.

	Re-write tests written for Graph to use catch instead of print statements
	Add GraphTraversal class
		Abstract class with pure virtual functions to model BFS and DFS traversals
		Conforms to iterator
	Add BFS
		Breadth-first-search conforming to GraphTraversal
		Copy one unit test from Graph tests and re-write to test BFS
	Add DFS
		Depth-first-search conforming to GraphTraversal
		Copy BFS unit test and switch to use BFS (will add more tests for both later)
